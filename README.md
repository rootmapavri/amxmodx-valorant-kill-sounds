# Amx Mod X Valorant Kill Sounds.

This plugin plays the post-kill '.wav' file for your 'counter Strike' '1.6' server using the 'amx mod x' API.
---
Caches sound files using `precache_sound`.
---
After the round ends, `round_start` resets the counter for each player and `.wav` starts the counter from zero for the audio file.
